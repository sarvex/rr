   * is pending for the tracee, then if the tracee was in a
   * syscall, linux has exited it with an -ERESTART* error code.
   * That means the tracee is about to (re-)enter either
   *
   *  1. buffered syscall
   *  2. disarm-desched ioctl syscall
   *
   * We can figure out which one by simply issuing a
   * ptrace(SYSCALL) and examining the tracee's registers.
   *
   * If the tracee enters the disarm-desched ioctl, it's going
   * to commit a record of the buffered syscall to the
   * syscallbuf, and we can safely send the tracee back on its
   * way, ignoring the desched completely.
   *
   * If it enters the buffered syscall, then the desched event
   * has served its purpose and we need to prepare the tracee to
   * be context-switched.
   *
   * An annoyance of the desched signal is that when the tracer
   * is descheduled in interval (C) above, we see normally (see
   * below) see *two* signals.  The current theory of what's
   * happening is
   *
   *  o child gets descheduled, bumps counter to i and schedules
   *    signal
   *  o signal notification "schedules" child, but it doesn't
   *    actually run any application code
   *  o child is being ptraced, so we "deschedule" child to
   *    notify parent and bump counter to i+1.  (The parent
   *    hasn't had a chance to clear the counter yet.)
   *  o another counter signal is generated, but signal is
   *    already pending so this one is queued
   *  o parent is notified and sees counter value i+1
   *  o parent stops delivery of first signal and disarms
   *    counter
   *  o second signal dequeued and delivered, notififying parent
   *    (counter is disarmed now, so no pseudo-desched possible
   *    here)
   *  o parent notifiedand sees counter value i+1 again
   *  o parent stops delivery of second signal and we continue on
   *
   * So we "work around" this by the tracer expecting two signal
   * notifications, and silently discarding both.
   *
   * One really fun edge case is that sometimes the desched
   * signal will interrupt the arm-desched syscall itself.
   * Continuing to the next syscall boundary seems to restart
   * the arm-desched syscall, and advancing to the boundary
   * again exits it and we start receiving desched signals
   * again.
   *
   * That may be a kernel bug, but we handle it by just
   * continuing until we we continue past the arm-desched
   * syscall *and* stop seeing signals. */
